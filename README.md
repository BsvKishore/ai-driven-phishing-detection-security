# AI-Driven Solution for Password Fatigue & Phishing Vulnerability

## Overview
This project presents an AI-driven approach to addressing two common cybersecurity challenges:
- Password fatigue
- Phishing-based credential compromise

The solution combines machine learning techniques with security-focused analysis to detect phishing attempts and improve user authentication awareness.  
All work was conducted in a controlled, educational environment.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze phishing patterns using data-driven methods
- Build a machine learning model to classify phishing attempts
- Reduce user risk caused by password reuse and phishing attacks
- Demonstrate how AI can enhance cybersecurity defenses

---

## Problem Statement
Password fatigue often leads users to reuse weak credentials, increasing susceptibility to phishing attacks.  
This project explores how AI-based detection can assist security teams in identifying phishing attempts and mitigating user risk.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning (classification models)
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Browser-based security concepts
- Security analytics and reporting

(Sensitive datasets and credentials are excluded.)

## Methodology (High-Level)
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   Collected and preprocessed phishing-related datasets.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Extracted relevant indicators used in phishing detection.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   Trained machine learning models to classify phishing attempts.

4. **Security Analysis**  
   Evaluated effectiveness from a cybersecurity defense perspective.

5. **Risk Mitigation Approach**  
   Proposed user-focused security improvements to reduce password fatigue.

## Results
- Improved detection accuracy for phishing attempts
- Demonstrated feasibility of AI-assisted security controls
- Highlighted limitations and areas for future improvement

---

## Ethical Considerations
- No real user credentials were used
- No live phishing campaigns were executed
- Project focuses on **defensive security applications**
